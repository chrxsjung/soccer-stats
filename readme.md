server.js begins by importing the necessary modules to make http requests and load environment variables. it then defines api routes that call the external api-football. this file runs as an express server during local development.

vite.config.js is the file that routes all local /api calls to the express server using a proxy.

on deployment, vercel handles /api routing with serverless functions, so vite doesn't do anything in production.

main.js fetches data from /api/.... in development, vite proxies that request to express. express fetches data from api-football and returns json. vite passes that json back to the browser. main.js receives the data and uses it to display player cards.

the json that express sends using res.json(data) is the http response that your main.js fetches and uses.

in production, vite isn’t running. it only builds the frontend files. the frontend fetches /api/..., which vercel handles directly with serverless functions.

Express handles the request, calls API-Football

Express responds: res.json(data)
